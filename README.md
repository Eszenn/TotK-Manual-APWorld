# TotKDemo-Manual-APWorld
A manual APWorld for implementing the Great Sky Island area of Tears of the Kingdom to the Archipelago Randomizer. 

## Prerequisites
Proper usage of this APWorld requires a save file that has cleared the Great Sky Island without collecting any koroks or chests, except for the 3 chests containing the Archaic armor set.
Upon receiving the Paraglider, drop everything in your inventory, then warp back to the Room of Awakening. If you hard save here, you can back up your save with Nintendo Switch Online
for reusability.

## Locations
The following are all locations that must be checked:
- Chests
- Koroks
- Shrines
- Minibosses
  
## Items to be Received
The following are all items that may be received:
- The 4 abilities obtained on the Great Sky Island
- The Paraglider
- The 3 armor pieces available on the Great Sky Island
- Zonai Device Capsules
- The ability to cook
- All 4 Lights of Blessing from the Great Sky Island

## Goal
The goal for this manual is to obtain all 4 Lights of Blessing to "open" the back door of the Temple of Time, as well as some method of reaching it.
The game is considered complete after passing through the door, but it's much more fun to dive to the surface.

## Other Info
For the purpose of this manual, the abilities normally obtained within the first 3 shrines are considered collected after entering the appropriate shrine for the first time.
The Recall location is considered collected upon reaching the altar within the Temple of Time, which requires 3 Lights of Blessing to open.
